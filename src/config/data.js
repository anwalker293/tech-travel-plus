          SO. You want to pass the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer exam.
          Well, here’s a full, robust, concrete guide on exactly how to do it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This will be beginner (or even near beginner friendly). I think the
          hardest part of this exam is definitely learning the concepts
          (especially Kubernetes and how Google starts up VMs behind the
          scenes), not to mention the products! This video will be split into
          two parts (a) my experience with the exam and (b) the path I recommend
          you take!
        </p>
        <br /> <br />
        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          So, I started off learning about Google Cloud in about October 2022,
          and I started off with the{" "}
          <a href="https://amzn.to/46hhU7P">official study guide</a>. Now, this
          is not to say that this{" "}
          <a href="https://amzn.to/46hhU7P">study guide</a> was bad, but, oh
          man, was I slammed with new concepts. I actually did atrociously on
          the practice tests, which wasn’t to say that I didn’t read the
          material, but I definitely didn’t understand it, and I definitely
          spent too much time trying to understand something whose level I
          wasn’t quite at yet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Needless to say, my main source of help was an{" "}
          <a href="https://learn.acloud.guru/course/gcp-certified-associate-cloud-engineer/overview">
            A Cloud Guru course
          </a>
          . I’ll put the link to this in the description. Yes, this course does
          cost a bit to take, but I definitely think it was worth it, especially
          to learn all of the new concepts. It has videos, that you can go
          through, practice labs, and practice questions. Further, in the middle
          of this course, it gives you a second course with full detailing on
          how Kubernetes works within Google Cloud, which I found essential for
          the exam.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After doing this course, THEN I felt comfortable reading the study
          guide. In fact, the <a href="https://amzn.to/46hhU7P">study guide</a>{" "}
          was almost a breeze now because (a) I had previously read it and (b)
          now fully understood what I was reading and concepts we were talking
          about.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Simultaneously, while reading the{" "}
          <a href="https://amzn.to/46hhU7P">study guide</a>, I started going
          through{" "}
          <a href="https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/associate-cloud-engineer/view/">
            ExamTopics

          and{" "}
          <a href="https://www.whizlabs.com/google-cloud-certified-associate-cloud-engineer/">
            Whizlabs
          </a>
          .{" "}
          <a href="https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/associate-cloud-engineer/view/">
            ExamTopics
          </a>{" "}
          has a whole bunch of free questions, which is helpful for preparing
          for the exam, BUT be warned that their labeled answers are not always
          right. Most of the real answers are in the discussion section for
          those questions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this reason, I would recommend taking all the practice questions
          from{" "}
          <a href="https://www.whizlabs.com/google-cloud-certified-associate-cloud-engineer/">
            Whizlabs
          </a>{" "}
          first.{" "}
          <a href="https://www.whizlabs.com/google-cloud-certified-associate-cloud-engineer/">
            Whizlabs
          </a>{" "}
          has detailed, accurate answers for all of their practice questions, so
          you can actually learn from the question. I think it would be ideal to
          take these questions first, and then return to{" "}
          <a href="https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/associate-cloud-engineer/view/">
            ExamTopics
          </a>
          , so you can use your, now better, discretion at the questions on{" "}
          <a href="https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/associate-cloud-engineer/view/">
            ExamTopics
          </a>
          . I’ve found both of these resources invaluable, as many of these
          questions show up super similarly on the actual exam.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Finally, I just got studying. I made acronyms for all of the google
          cloud products (which I think was one of the most difficult parts),
          and, for any question I missed, I made sure to review them all before
          the exam.
        </p>

            <p>
              For each exam you complete, record the question you got down
              wrong. I would recommend reviewing these questions daily. Also
              record, if you encounter them, any new Google Cloud products or
              definitely products you keep encountering but can’t remember. I’ve
              found it helpful to create acronyms of these products.

            <p>
              I’ve found this study guide to be much harder than the actual

              exam.

              Lots of these questions are free and show their face on the exam.
              HOWEVER, lots of the answers are not right, so you should go to
              the discussion section to determine the best answer. However, if
              you’ve done A, B, and C, you should now be well equipped to use
              your own discretion to answer these questions.

            <br />
            <p>
              I think it’s easy, in this exam, to never feel fully prepared.
              But, especially if you’ve memorized your acronyms for products and
              are accurately answering the majority of the questions you got
              wrong before, you’ll do great.

          I do want to preface with a warning of:{" "}
          <b>
            <i>don’t study too much!</i>
          </b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There comes a point where, if you keep studying, most of the material
          you’re studying won’t be on the exam, and, for an exam that shouldn’t
          take you that long, you’ll end up studying double for it. Know when to
          call it quits.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Coding in ACA-Py just got a whole lot easier with Indicio’s a simple,
          hackable repo
        </h3>
        <br />
        Indicio recently unveiled its{" "}

          Minimal Example Repo
        </a>
        , built with both experienced developers and those just starting out and
        in mind.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>What is it?</h4> Indicio’s{" "}
        <a
          href="https://github.com/Indicio-tech/acapy-minimal-example"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Minimal Example repo (AME)
        </a>{" "}
        is a simple, hackable repo containing the building blocks to quickly
        reproduce an issue or demonstrate a feature within ACA-Py.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Who is it for?</h4> Developers and testers (especially those new to
        ACA-Py) who are looking to build scenarios with ACA-Py will find the
        repo very useful, whether they are seeking to quickly reproduce an issue
        (such as revocation, trust pings, issuing and verifying a simple
        credential, or sending messages between agents) or to demonstrate a
        feature by writing one simple script or Pytest test. The repo cuts down
        on the amount of time searching through documentation, while also being
        approachable to developers new to ACA-Py. Instead of looking through all
        the Aries RFCs, Indicio’s Aca-Py Minimal Example will help autofill
        certain scenarios for you.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>How does it make using ACA-Py faster / convenient?</h4> It gives you
        a significant head start in replicating scenarios in ACA-Py. For
        example, a traditional exchange between an Alice and Bob¹ agent can be
        found in `minimal_example.py.` It allows you to quickly copy, paste, and
        modify the components you need to get your scenario to work, without all
        of the hassle of sorting through the Aries RFCs documentation.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>What is available now?</h4> Presently, we have examples constructed,
        with revocation support, for a traditional Alice and Bob agent scenario,
        supporting protocol versions 1 and 2, and are working to add more
        functionality. Further work will include generators for other common
        agent setups (`Dockerfile`s + `docker-compose.yml`) such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Alice, Bob, Mediator</li>
          <li>Issuer, Holder, Verifier</li>
          <li>Endorser, Issuer, Holder, Verifier</li>
          <li>
            ACA-Py, Echo (Remote controlled static agent; for sending raw
            messages)
          </li>
          <li>
            Any combination of the above with a specified set of plugins

        <i>A.) Determine the scenario you are writing. </i>
        <br />
        What does this flow look like? What all needs to happen in this flow?
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>
          B.) Determine if the AME repo fully or partly supports that scenario.

        Is the scenario you are looking for already written?
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>
          C.) Copy and paste the portions that are relevant to the scenario you
          are working on and modify it accordingly.
        </i>
        <br />
        <br />
