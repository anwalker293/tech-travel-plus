You want to pass the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer exam.\n          Well, here’s a full, robust, concrete guide on exactly how to do it.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          This will be beginner (or even near beginner friendly). I think the\n          hardest part of this exam is definitely learning the concepts\n          (especially Kubernetes and how Google starts up VMs behind the\n          scenes), not to mention the products! This video will be split into\n          two parts (a) my experience with the exam and (b) the path I recommend\n          you take!\n        </p>\n        <br /> <br />\n        <h3>My Experience</h3>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          So, I started off learning about Google Cloud in about October 2022,\n          and I started off with the official study guide. Now, this is not to\n          say that this study guide was bad, but, oh man, was I slammed with new\n          concepts. I actually did atrociously on the practice tests, which\n          wasn’t to say that I didn’t read the material, but I definitely didn’t\n          understand it, and I definitely spent too much time trying to\n          understand something whose level I wasn’t quite at yet.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          Needless to say, my main source of help was an A Cloud Guru course.\n          I’ll put the link to this in the description. Yes, this course does\n          cost a bit to take, but I definitely think it was worth it, especially\n          to learn all of the new concepts. It has videos, that you can go\n          through, practice labs, and practice questions. Further, in the middle\n          of this course, it gives you a second course with full detailing on\n          how Kubernetes works within Google Cloud, which I found essential for\n          the exam.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          After doing this course, THEN I felt comfortable reading the study\n          guide. In fact, the study guide was almost a breeze now because (a) I\n          had previously read it and (b) now fully understood what I was reading\n          and concepts we were talking about.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          Simultaneously, while reading the study guide, I started going through\n          ExamTopics and Whizlabs. ExamTopics has a whole bunch of free\n          questions, which is helpful for preparing for the exam, BUT be warned\n          that their labeled answers are not always right. Most of the real\n          answers are in the discussion section for those questions.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          For this reason, I would recommend taking all the practice questions\n          from Whizlabs first. Whizlabs has detailed, accurate answers for all\n          of their practice questions, so you can actually learn from the\n          question. I think it would be ideal to take these questions first, and\n          then return to ExamTopics, so you can use your, now better, discretion\n          at the questions on ExamTopics. I’ve found both of these resources\n          invaluable, as many of these questions show up super similarly on the\n          actual exam.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          Finally, I just got studying. I made acronyms for all of the google\n          cloud products (which I think was one of the most difficult parts),\n          and, for any question I missed, I made sure to review them all before\n          the exam.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <h3>\n          More Details on How Exactly I Prepared for the Google Cloud Associate\n          Cloud Engineer Exam\n        </h3>\n        <iframe\n          width=\"560\"\n          height=\"315\"\n          src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0hd-D4k78U\"\n          frameborder=\"0\"\n          allowfullscreen\n        ></iframe>\n        <br />\n        <h3>Recommended Path</h3>\n        <br />\n        <ul>\n          <li>A. Take the Associate Cloud Engineer A Cloud Guru Course.</li>\n          <li>\n            B. Take exams on Whizlabs, except save one for last. For each exam\n            you complete, record the question you got down wrong. I would\n            recommend reviewing these questions daily. Also record, if you\n            encounter them, any new Google Cloud products or definitely products\n            you keep encountering but can’t remember. I’ve found it helpful to\n            create acronyms of these products.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            C. Read through the Official Study Guide and take practice\n            questions. I’ve found this study guide to be much harder than the\n            actual exam, which I found was perfect for preparation going into\n            the exam.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <b>D. Go through ExamTopics.</b>\n            <p>\n              Lots of these questions are free and show their face on the exam.\n              HOWEVER, lots of the answers are not right, so you should go to\n              the discussion section to determine the best answer. However, if\n              you’ve done A, B, and C, you should now be well equipped to use\n              your own discretion to answer these questions.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <b>E. Take that last whizlabs practice exam.</b> You’ve got this!\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <b>F. Go get ‘em!</b>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              I think it’s easy, in this exam, to never feel fully prepared.\n              But, especially if you’ve memorized your acronyms for products and\n              are accurately answering the majority of the questions you got\n              wrong before, you’ll do great.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    ),\n    authorName: \"Alexandra N.
