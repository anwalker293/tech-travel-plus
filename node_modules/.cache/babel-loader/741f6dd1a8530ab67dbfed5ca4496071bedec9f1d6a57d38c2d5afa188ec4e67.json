I think the\n          hardest part of this exam is definitely learning the concepts\n          (especially Kubernetes and how Google starts up VMs behind the\n          scenes), not to mention the products!

Now, this\n          is not to say that this{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"https://amzn.to/46hhU7P\">study guide</a> was bad, but, oh\n          man, was I slammed with new concepts. I actually did atrociously on\n          the practice tests, which wasn’t to say that I didn’t read the\n          material, but I definitely didn’t understand it, and I definitely\n          spent too much time trying to understand something whose level I\n          wasn’t quite at yet.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          Needless to say, my main source of help was an{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"https://learn.acloud.guru/course/gcp-certified-associate-cloud-engineer/overview\">\n            A Cloud Guru course\n          </a>\n          . I’ll put the link to this in the description. Yes, this course does\n          cost a bit to take, but I definitely think it was worth it, especially\n          to learn all of the new concepts. It has videos, that you can go\n          through, practice labs, and practice questions. Further, in the middle\n          of this course, it gives you a second course with full detailing on\n          how Kubernetes works within Google Cloud, which I found essential for\n          the exam.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          After doing this course, THEN I felt comfortable reading the study\n          guide.

The repo cuts down\n        on the amount of time searching through documentation, while also being\n        approachable to developers new to ACA-Py. Instead of looking through all\n        the Aries RFCs, Indicio’s Aca-Py Minimal Example will help autofill\n        certain scenarios for you.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <h4>How does it make using ACA-Py faster / convenient?</h4> It gives you\n        a significant head start in replicating scenarios in ACA-Py. For\n        example, a traditional exchange between an Alice and Bob¹ agent can be\n        found in `minimal_example.py.` It allows you to quickly copy, paste, and\n        modify the components you need to get your scenario to work, without all\n        of the hassle of sorting through the Aries RFCs documentation.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <h4>What is available now?</h4> Presently, we have examples constructed,\n        with revocation support, for a traditional Alice and Bob agent scenario,\n        supporting protocol versions 1 and 2, and are working to add more\n        functionality.
